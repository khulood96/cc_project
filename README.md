## Project Description ##
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate our knowledge of the compiler and how it functions, based on what we've learned in class. 
We were supposed to select a language of our choice, from three given options, and display our knowledge of this course by building a lexical analyzer and a parser.
My aim was to fulfill the purpose of this project, putting as much effort and time as required to achieve these two goals.

## Sample Language Used ##
The sample language I chose for this project, was ChocoPy.

Replace this text with the desription of what was your sample language. You may include some code examples of loops, if and simple statements 
```C++
#include <some code examples.h>
printf("This is a loop example!");
for(int i=0; i<10 ; i++){
    printf("Please Allah Forgive me. I cheated in exam while fasting!");
}
```
###Lexical Specification###


###Grammar###
Replace this text with a complete GRAMMAR of your selected language

##Problems Faced##
